TO DO:

#### Behaviour
- Make bot say something when alone
    . Someone enters
    . By himself

#### Commands

- meet (need calendar update on site)
- facts
    . User swear count
    . Logs the most
    . Kicked the most
- meow
- roof (dog)
- check (see below for example from #bash)
- Private message from registered user to bot to channel (like that's what she said)

```
<dualbus> http://sprunge.us/CRVa
<dualbus> !check
<checkbot> dualbus: shellcheck.net says: Line 40: Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true. Line 5: Double quote to prevent globbing and word splitting. Line 60: Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true (and 10 more)
```

#### Backgroud

- Remove self logging
- Add security (?)

Example from #bash on FreeNode
